# ðŸŒ¸ Cute CSS Gradients Generator ðŸŒ¸

Hi, there! 
Thank you for reading this. ðŸŒŸ
This is a client for a gradient generator page. You can actually save themes and copy the CSS code to your clipboard.

## ðŸŽ€ Getting started
* Clone this repository.
* Install dependencies running ```$ npm install``` command.
* [Clone this repo](https://github.com/karenascencio/gradient-generator-api) as well, run ```$ npm install``` then start the api with ```$ npm run dev``` (for this, you will need a .env with the environment variables). If you can't get the variables, don't worry, you can use the page as well but you won't be able to save themes or see any saved themes.
* Run ```$ npm start``` to run the page.


## ðŸŽ€ Guide
* If started correctly, you will see the following page:

* As you can see, the page will give you a random combination of colors.
* To customize your own gradient, first you have to choose a style which can be linear or radial:
